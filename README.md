# carnivora

This is the Repository for my Django Instagram Bot Wrapper. 

The Instagram bot gently simulates real user behaviour by automatedly liking, commenting, following and unfollowing. Uses the telepot API for remote controlling and an optimization algorithm which detects and chooses from the most profitable Instagram hashtags.
